# Pokemon-Database
This is a pokemon database that I made using PostgreSQL. First I made an ER diagram and relational schema and then used PGAdmin to write the queries and make the database. The write up in the file "Pokemon Database Project.docx" contains the data and functional requirements, the ER diagram, and the relational schema.
